# Hello, I'm nameXDD!

#### Actually I'm energetic engineer 👷🏼 and working with electrical and automatic systems.

###### It's all about my real life . . .

### But here I'm a middle game designer and project manager 🎮
I working with Minecraft projects in the Russian community and am happy with it.
##### My portfolio as game designer / project manager:
1. High-sky (not working)
2. MineGamesCraft (not working)
3. Minecraft way of war (startup, not working)
4. Streamcraft (minigames server manager)
5. Cristalix 2.0 (project manager and client-side support and developing)

I love realizing crazy ideas and showing our community new mechanics and solutions for Minecraft (and not for this only)!

#### Not only Minecraft I love. I like MMO RPG games and have my own startup
